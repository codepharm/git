            <p>A Mycenean fresco depicts two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield; this may depict the warrior-goddess with her palladium, or her palladium in an aniconic
              representation.
              Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. In art, she is generally depicted wearing a helmet and holding a spear</p>

              From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as Polias and Poliouchos (both derived from polis, meaning "city-state"), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified
              acropolis in the central part of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as Ergane. She was also a
              warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as Athena Promachos. Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was the most important festival
              on the Athenian calendar.</p>

            <p>Athena appears frequently in classical Greek art, including on coins and in paintings on ceramics.She is especially prominent in works produced in Athens. In classical depictions, Athena is usually portrayed standing upright, wearing a
              full-length chiton. She is most often represented dressed in armor like a male soldier and wearing a Corinthian helmet raised high atop her forehead. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (gorgoneion) in
              the center and snakes around the edge. Sometimes she is shown wearing the aegis as a cloak. As Athena Promachos,she is shown brandishing a spear.Scenes in which Athena was represented include her birth from the head of Zeus, her battle
              with the Gigantes, the birth of Erichthonius, and the Judgement of Paris.</p>
